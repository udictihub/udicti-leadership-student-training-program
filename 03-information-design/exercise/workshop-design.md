# üßë‚Äçüè´Module 3: Workshop Design

## Workshop introduction

- What is the title of your workshop?


- Who is the target audience?



- How long will your workshop be?



## Learning objectives

List 2-3 learning objectives. These generally start with **'learners will understand'** or **'learners can'**. Remember to be realistic about what can be achieved in the length of your workshop.


 
<details><summary>Examples</summary>
Learning objectives should talk about clear aims for the workshop from the
perspective of the learner. They should all follow a standard format:

> Learners will... [understand/be able to] *insert item here*

For example:

1. Learners will be able to submit a pull request
2. Learners will be able to build a calculator application in Kotlin
3. Learners will understand the differences between Docker and Kubernetes

Please make sure your learning objectives follow this format.

## Assessment

- What will learners make to show you that they've mastered each learning objective?



- What are the criteria for success for each objective?



We recommend not to use quizzes as a means of assessment. The best way to understand skills is to design assessments that ask learners to use those skills. For example, if your workshop is on HTML and CSS the assessment should involve building and styling a webpage using specific techniques taught in the workshop.

## Activities

What content, exercises, and support will you provide to help learners work towards the assessment? Here are some tips:

- Create discrete steps - build multiple smaller things that add up to something bigger
- Authentic - only design activities that teach skills that learners will actually use in the assessment
- Agency & Appeal: make sure that activities matter to learners, and they want to be able to do it
- How will you utilize the Pain Dream Fix model in your activities?

## Feedback
<details><summary>Tips</summary>
You can increase the feedback rate by setting aside 5 minutes in the end for people to fill in a feedback survey before they leave. If you wait until afterward, your response rate will plummet.
