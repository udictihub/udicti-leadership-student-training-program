Now that you've thought about your community's shared struggles and learned some new skills, it's time to take some action! Use this template to help you fill out your proposal. We invite you to change the contents of this template around and use the embedded tips and evaluation criteria to help you make an âœ¨ impact on your community.

Please leave all of the headers in your final submission, and answer each of questions we pose with a detailed explanation.

## Summary of the community's shared struggles

Provide a summary of what you believe your community's shared struggles to be, coupled with the feedback from others (like the opinion of existing Campus Experts, community leaders, and stakeholders).

## What does your community look like once its shared struggles are solved?

This is more long term - 3, 5 or 10 years. The following pieces might help strengthen this section:

- Community demographics and inclusion: Include data gathered from your previous modules: the size of the community that you are targeting with your proposal, the educational background of your community, the resources they currently have at their disposal and how your community is inclusive and welcoming to all.
- Communication: For a community to thrive, they need to be able to communicate with each other, identify how your community will be able to stay in-contact. This includes in-person meetings, webinars, and chat/forum platforms.
- Activities: what activities does this community-run to keep people coming back for more?

## Proposal
This section is you telling us what you'll do as a Campus Expert to positively impact your community. We want to see detailed descriptions and plans for how you'll do things so we can properly support you.

What are the different activities you need to do to solve your community's shared struggles? For each item, don't forget to mention:

- What problems it solves
- How the activity directly impacts the problem
- How you'll make sure it is successful

## Resources

- What resources do you need to accomplish your proposal? Resources could be space, funds, or equipment.
- How will you obtain those resources?
- How many other people do you need to support you in delivering this proposal? Will they need specific roles or skills?
- How will you find these people?

## Timeline

Provide a detailed, broken-down timeline of what needs to be done to make your proposal successful. It should detail who should do the task, and when. We'd like to see at least the next 6-9 months of the plan. 


## Planning for the Future

In this section, think about how your efforts can expand through your time as a Campus Expert. Some questions you can answer that might help strengthen this section are:

- When will you review the impact of your proposal?
- How will you measure success?
- How frequently will you iterate on your community plans?
