## Introduction to this exercise

In this exercise you will:

- Submit a talk proposal

# ðŸŽ™Module 4: Talk Proposal
## Talk planning

Tell us a little bit about your talk:

- What is the topic?
- Why do you care about it?
- What story might you be able to tell?
- What is your goal? It might be to inform, persuade or entertain.
- Who is the intended audience in terms of skills, interests and experience?

## Early outline

Write an early outline for the structure of your talk. We don't expect lots of detail, just a bullet point list of what you'll talk about, and in what order.

## Talk proposal

### Talk title

Create a short snappy title for your talk

### Abstract

Imagine you're at a conference and your talk has been accepted. At the same time as your talk, there are two others. An abstract is your talk's elevator pitch - convince people why they should come to yours. Start with some context, a problem statement or claim, and continue into your solution and a description of what the talk will be like.

Your abstract should be between 150-200 words as 1-2 paragraphs. For examples of good abstract formatting and content, [click on each of the speakers who spoke at a conference ran in January](https://yougotthis.io/talks/) for inspiration.
