## Introduction to this exercise

In this exercise, you will:
- Create an explanation for basic Git commands
- Understand Git commands.
## Explaining git concepts

In this exercise, you will write an explanation for various git concepts.

- Don't assume any prior knowledge of git: imagine you are explaining these concepts to a brand new software developer. Because of this, try not to use jargon.
- Write full, complete prose. Bullet points can be useful, but not what we're after for this module.
- Test the explanation. Try your explanation on a non-technical friend before submitting it.

We want explanations for:

- git
- repository
- remote
- branching
- merging
- merge conflicts
- the three git states:
  - modified
  - staging
  - committed
