## Introduction to this exercise

In this exercise you will:
- Identify often excluded groups within your context.
- Analyze possible scenarios that might affect the inclusion, diversity, and accessibility of your community.
- Design for your community needs
- Write a Code of Conduct.

# ðŸ’– Module 2: Inclusion Analysis
It's fair to say that many tech communities do not take steps to ensure that everyone is welcome - especially marginalized groups. This is something we make sure to see before approving people to move on to the next stage of the Campus Experts application. In the video, Bianca talks about 'Designing for the Margins', which is about taking intentional steps to make sure that everyone is included in your community. This module is *not* about general or logistical challenges - it's purely about inclusion.

Here's a nice framework for making observations actionable:

- Observation (what?): we don't have many women take part in our community
- Hypothesis (so what?): we may not be as inclusive as we can be to women? Maybe they feel like this isn't a place for them? Why might that be?
- Changes (now what?): play around with changing things and measure impact. It could be messaging, lack of a diverse organizing team (not seeing someone 'like me' in the community), the timing of your activities, etc.
- Assessment (did that work?): assess if your changes made a positive impact, iterate, start again.</details>

## Who might be excluded from accessing your community activities in their current form?

Take some time to think about who **might be excluded** from your community and why this might be. Some examples might include: 
- People with jobs 
- People with caring responsibilities such as a child or another family member
- Wheelchair users
- Women, LGBTQ+ and non-binary people
- Mature students

This is far from a complete list, but enough to get started.

## Handling negative scenarios

### What are some of the negative scenarios which might happen while running activities for your community which will make them less inclusive to marginalized groups?

*Provide at least 4-5 examples*



### What steps will you take to avoid these scenarios?

Thinking about how to avoid these scenarios from the beginning is key. For each of the examples above, provide a brief explanation about how you'll avoid them happening.


## Designing for your community's needs

### Needs facilitated

What needs are you going to make efforts to facilitate? How will you facilitate them?



### Needs not facilitated

What needs won't you be able to facilitate? Why is this?



## Provide a link to your Code of Conduct
Every community should have a clear Code of Conduct. It should be specific about what behavior is encouraged, what is unacceptable, and how you will respond to those who break the rules. It should also be accessed easily online - so please provide a link to it here.

    - Link to my community code of conduct [Udicti Code Of Conduct](UDICTI-CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)

All good Code of Conducts should have the following clear sections:

1. Expected behavior (to reinforce)
2. Unacceptable behavior(to reduce ambiguity)
3. How to report: Add contact information like an email to report incidents.
4. What will happen if people break it (to set expectations)

A good example of a community Code of Conduct is the Udicti Code Of Conduct [Code of Conduct](../../../UDICTI-CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md) which is based in the Contributor Covenant


Note: this should be a specific code of conduct for your community, not a generic one.
