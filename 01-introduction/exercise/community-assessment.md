## Community Definition

How would you define your community? Try to be open-minded, but here are some examples of ways you could define your community:

- Is it a computer science club , a special interest group or a hub?



- Is it a formally recognized community such as a student society, or is it an informal community such as a friendship group?



- Does your community share interests or an environment?



- How long has your community existed?



- How big is your community? Has it always been this size?



## What are your community's shared struggles?

- What are the problems that are or will bring your community members together? They can be anything but are commonly focused on working towards better skills, grades, or jobs. *Add 3-5 bullet points.*



## What is the mission of your community?
 - Based on your community's shared struggles, what is your community's mission? Keep this short and snappy.



- Note: this is not your personal mission but the overarching mission of your community. An example of a mission might be `'Our aim is the equip everyone, regardless of their major, with technical skills to increase their job prospects.'`

## What do members look to get from your community?
